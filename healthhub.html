<summary>Community</summary>
<div class="communitytext">
<p>University life can feel isolating at times, especially because it is a major transition period for most of students. Finding a community is crucial in these times. It provides a sense of belonging, a network of support, and opportunities for personal growth and development. Communities can be found in various forms within the university settingâ€”clubs, sports teams, study groups, or through shared interests and courses. Engaging with these groups can help alleviate feelings of isolation and contribute to a more fulfilling university experience. </p>
